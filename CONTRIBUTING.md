# Contributing to pi-pack
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/richardgill/pi-pack.git
   cd pi-pack
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

3. Run the CLI in development mode:
   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```

   **Tip:** You can run the dev CLI from any directory using `--cwd`:
   ```sh
   bun run --cwd /path/to/pi-pack dev install "npm:@foo/bar@1.0.0"
   ```

   **Tip:** Add a shell alias for quick access (run this from the pi-pack directory):
   ```sh
   alias pi-packdev="PI_PACK_CWD=\"\$PWD\" bun run --cwd $(pwd) dev"
   ```
   This bakes in the pi-pack path at definition time, while `$PWD` expands to your working directory at execution time.

   Or generate the alias with your current path (run from the pi-pack directory):
   ```sh
   echo 'alias pi-packdev='"'"'PI_PACK_CWD="$PWD" bun run --cwd '"$(pwd)"' dev'"'"''
   ```
